                            <li>The only real challenge was just how I wanted to make the assignment look. The coding was pretty easy for this assignment.</li>
                            <li>I learned how to make imbed an image not from the web. I already knew most of the basics to html. </li>
                            <li>The most usefull thing for me was the example code just to see look back and different syntext.</li>

                            <li>The most challenging part of the assignment for me was figuring out how to get the post boxs to all fit right and how to get the picture inside to size correctly.</li>
                            <li>I learned how to use css classes to use different styles. I didn't have any specific insights. I already knew how to change fonts. </li>
                            <li>The most usefull thing for me was the example code just to see how different things interacted and syntext.</li>
                            <li>I had to google how to resize an imagine to only fit into a certain space and not look all wonky. Another thing was the documentation on positioning.</li>
